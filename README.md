 <p> Wagerly is built using cutting-edge technology such as Next.js 13.4, React, TypeScript, Prisma, MongoDB, and SCSS. The sports and news data is provided by the <a href='https://gist.github.com/akeaswaran/b48b02f1c94f873c6655e7129910fc3b'>ESPN api</a>. Some of the dependencies include <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt'>bcrypt</a> for safe password guarding, <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment'>moment</a> for date / time formatting, <a href="https://react-hot-toast.com/">react-hot-toast</a> for popup notifications, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/swr">swr</a> for easy api fetching, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons">react-icons</a> for the icons displayed, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios">axios</a> for the backend fetching, and much more.

  Since the <a href='https://gist.github.com/akeaswaran/b48b02f1c94f873c6655e7129910fc3b'>ESPN api</a> is a <a href="https://ianlondon.github.io/blog/web-scraping-discovering-hidden-apis/">hidden api</a>, most endpoints are not well known and it takes some digging to find them. As more API endpoints are found, they will be added to the site, so stay tuned if your favorite sport is not currently available on Wagerly!

  <h2>Why was Wagerly built?</h2>
  <p>Wagerly was built as a personal side project. Currently, the site is developed and maintained by myself. It was created to get more familiar with Nextjs by discovering its capabilities in a large-scale application. My main goals for this site are speed, user interface design, mobile friendliness, and learning the best practices for the now stable <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app">Nextjs 13 app directory</a>.</p>
